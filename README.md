# CS210 Programming Languages
Develop functional programs that comply with industry regulations and best practices using various programming languages.

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Wildlife Zoo is considering new radio frequency identifier (RFID) chip technology to track the animals in their care. However, the tracking technology that they 
are looking at stores data on the animals but does not allow for maintenance. Wildlife Zoo would like a prototype, or preliminary model, built of a system that 
will interface with the tracking system and allow for maintenance of their animal data.

# What did you do particularly well?
For my current skill level, I am proud of my animal type and sub-type hierarchy, my use of structures, and various code like trimming white * spaces and converting strings to integer type.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
In my belief, code can always be improved upon. I could of organized my code better by creating header and source files for each of the animal types and 
sub-types instead of having just one source file. I also could of done a better job of implementing error-handling code.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Many aspects of this project were challenging at my current skill level. This was a challenging project for a C++ intro course. I did a lot of researching on 
ZyBooks and on various C++ forums to find information and 
solutions to my problems.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects is how to utilize various programming languages to develop secure, efficient code. I was 
able to successfully run this project by using C++ and Java effectively.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using well placed comments, proper white spacing, and using industry standard terms.
